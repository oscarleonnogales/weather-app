# Weather App

A small project that was a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. A sleek, simple, and responsive weather application. The app uses your IP address to find your location and renders a different background depending on the time of day, location, and weather. Weather data is fetched in real time from weatherAPI. Units are based on the search location.
